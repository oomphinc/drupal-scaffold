# Drupal git normalization

# Normally these settings would be done with macro attributes for improved
# readability and easier maintenance. However macros can only be defined at the
# repository root directory. Drupal avoids making any assumptions about where it
# is installed.

# Define text file attributes.
# - Treat them as text.
# - Ensure no CRLF line-endings, neither on checkout nor on checkin.
# - Detect whitespace errors.
#   - Exposed by default in `git diff --color` on the CLI.
#   - Validate with `git diff --check`.
#   - Deny applying with `git apply --whitespace=error-all`.
#   - Fix automatically with `git apply --whitespace=fix`.
