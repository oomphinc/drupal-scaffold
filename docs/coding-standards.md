# Coding standards

This project comes with linting tools to check the syntax of custom code against
established coding standards/recommendations. Linters are available for the
following languages:

* JavaScript (ES6)
* PHP
* SASS

## JavaScript (ES6)

The validator for custom JavaScript is [ESLint][]. This project uses the
`/web/core/.eslintrc.json` file to validated custom JavaScript. The [ESLint][]
file provided by [Drupal][] core follows the
[Drupal coding standards for JavaScript][].

To validate JavaScript files use `npm run lint`.

## PHP

The validator for custom PHP is [PHPCS][]. This project uses the `drupal/coder`
package to validate custom PHP files against the
[Drupal coding standards for PHP][].

To validate PHP files use `ddev phpcs`.

## SASS

The validator for custom SASS is [stylelint][]. This project uses the
[SASS Guidelines][] with _some_ modifications:

To validate SASS files use `npm run lint`.

* There is a max nesting limit (max-nesting-depth) of 4
* Qualifying a selector by type is allowed (selector-no-qualifying-type)
* Maximum allowed compound selectors is increased from 3 to 4 (selector-max-compound-selectors)
* Alphabetical order of properties is not enforced (order/properties-alphabetical-order)

**Rule:** `max-nesting-depth`
* SASS Guidelines recommended setting is `1` but then, what is the point of SASS
* we override this setting to 4.

**Rule:** `selector-no-qualifying-type`
* Qualifying a selector by type is allowed.

**Rule** `selector-max-compound-selectors`
* Maximum allowed compound selectors is increased from 3 to 4.

**Rule** `order/properties-alphabetical-order`
* Alphabetical order of properties is not enforced.

To temporarily disable the linter for certain code blocks you can use the syntax
below. More information can be found in the linter [docs][].

```
/* stylelint-disable selector-no-id, declaration-no-important  */
#id {
  color: pink !important;
}
/* stylelint-enable */
```

To disable a single property.
```
.class {
  -webkit-appearance: none; // stylelint-disable-line property-no-vendor-prefix
}
```
